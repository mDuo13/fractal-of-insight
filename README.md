# Fractal of Insight
A Grand Archive TCG tournament analysis site

This site shows information and analysis of Grand Archive tournament results. It uses the Omnidex API, which is beta and subject to change without notice, in a way that is officially unsupported but hopefully OK with Weebs of the Shore.

## TODO / Planned Features

- handle username changes and maybe user ID changes too
- handle multiple decklists for worlds events (incl. stats)
- improve performance on large event pages (e.g. team standard 2025, Ascent KL)
- bugfix: clicking on players in the match listing doesn't work on mobile sometimes
- stats / meta composition split by seat in teams (e.g. all the fire decks on seat C)
- refine archetype classification
    - use machine-learning clustering to identify archetypes?
    - archetype overlap chart?
- calculate stats on upsets
- make dynamic sections, i.e. flask app or something, for showing individual events or doing dynamic queries
- track seasonal invites, if possible? (might require sideloading number of invites per event)
- sideboard / tech cards prevalence rate (season/format)
- path of silver data
- conversion rate to top cut / day 2
- achievement for advanced elements
- top users per card
- improve VOD list on archetype pages
