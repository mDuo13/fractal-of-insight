# Fractal of Insight
A Grand Archive TCG tournament analysis site

This site shows information and analysis of Grand Archive tournament results. It uses the Omnidex API, which is beta and subject to change without notice, in a way that is officially unsupported but hopefully OK with Weebs of the Shore.

## TODO / Planned Features

- refine archetype classification
    - use machine-learning clustering to identify archetypes?
    - archetype overlap chart?
- calculate stats on upsets
- champion overviews / stats
- make dynamic sections, i.e. flask app or something, for showing individual events or doing dynamic queries
- track seasonal invites, if possible? (might require sideloading number of invites per event)
- two-way rivalry stats?
- sideboard / tech cards prevalence rate (event/season)
- path of silver data
- conversion rate to top cut
- card profile overlay with flip for DFCs
