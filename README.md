# Fractal of Insight
A Grand Archive TCG tournament analysis site

This site shows information and analysis of Grand Archive tournament results. It uses the Omnidex API, which is beta and subject to change without notice, in a way that is officially unsupported but hopefully OK with Weebs of the Shore.

## TODO / Planned Features

- improve performance of large event pages (e.g. team standard 2025, Ascent KL)
- fix automatic mid-event updates for multi-day events
- refine archetype classification
    - use machine-learning clustering to identify archetypes?
    - archetype overlap chart?
    - add advanced elements to name without needing them to be archetypes necessarily
- calculate stats on upsets
- make dynamic sections, i.e. flask app or something, for showing individual events or doing dynamic queries
- track seasonal invites, if possible? (might require sideloading number of invites per event)
- sideboard / tech cards prevalence rate (season/format)
- path of silver data
- conversion rate to top cut / day 2
- advanced elements stats - number of decks with them, ratios in decks (average), etc. as charts preferably.
- achievement for advanced elements
- top users per card
- improve VOD list on archetype pages
- show multiple regions for player profiles where players' home region has changed
- improve presentation of price data
- improve searching for players, cards. maybe make some tables sortable.
- add new cards or per-season variants for archetype card lists
