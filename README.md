# Fractal of Insight
A Grand Archive TCG tournament analysis site

This site shows information and analysis of Grand Archive tournament results. It uses the Omnidex API, which is beta and subject to change without notice, in a way that is officially unsupported but hopefully OK with Weebs of the Shore.

## TODO / Planned Features

- improve performance of large event pages (e.g. team standard 2025, Ascent KL)
- fix automatic mid-event updates for multi-day events
- stats / meta composition split by seat in teams (e.g. was seat C really heavy on fire decks?)
- refine archetype classification
    - use machine-learning clustering to identify archetypes?
    - archetype overlap chart?
- calculate stats on upsets
- make dynamic sections, i.e. flask app or something, for showing individual events or doing dynamic queries
- track seasonal invites, if possible? (might require sideloading number of invites per event)
- sideboard / tech cards prevalence rate (season/format)
- path of silver data
- conversion rate to top cut / day 2
- advanced elements stats - number of decks with them, ratios in decks, etc. as charts preferably.
- achievement for advanced elements
- top users per card
- improve VOD list on archetype pages
- show multiple regions for player profiles where players' home region has changed
- fix team standard display on archetype deck listing
- maybe exclude blatantly invalid decklists from stats and archetype listings?
